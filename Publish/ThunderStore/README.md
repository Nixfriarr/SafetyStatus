# SafetyStatus
Adds a new status effect (Safe) that indicates if you are within range of a structure that prevents monsters from spawning (such as beds or other objects that have a PlayerBase effect). Useful if you're trying to spawn-proof your base. 

## Instructions
If you are using a mod manager for Thunderstore simply install the mod from there. If you are not using a mod manager then, you need a modded instance of Valheim (BepInEx) and the Jotunn plugin installed.

## Known Issues
None so far, tell me if you find any.

## Compatibility
Fully compatible with mods that add PlayerBase effects to existing pieces.

## Donations/Tips
My mods will always be free to use but if you feel like saying thanks you can tip/donate.

### Contributions
If you would like to provide suggestions, make feature requests, or reports bugs and compatibility issues you can either open an issue on the Github repository or tag me (@searica) with a bug report on my discord [Searica's Mods](https://discord.gg/sFmGTBYN6n).

I'm a grad student and have a lot of personal responsibilities on top of that so I can't promise I will respond quickly, but I do intend to maintain and improve the mod in my free time.

### Credits
This mod was inspired by Safe Zone by Koosemose.
